    <p>Strawberry Pop Tarts may be a cheap and inexpensive source of incendiary devices. Toasters which fail to eject Pop Tarts cause the Pop Tarts to emit flames 10-18 inches in height. Last year, an article by well-known newspaper columnist <i>Dave Barry</i> notes that <i>Kellog's Strawberry Pop Tarts</i> (SPTs) could be made to emit flames "like a blow torch" if left in a toaster too long. Given previous work in the field of food-entertainment (see <i><a href="https://google.com" target=_blank>Fun With Grapes - A Case Study</a></i>), it was obvious that this was a new frontier that requires further exploration. The present work describes our independent verification and experience with SPT-based combustion.</p>
    <h1>Materials Used</h1>
    <p>Only two basic materials are needed to cause SPT-combustions: a (hopefully expensive) toaster and some Strawberry Pop Tarts (Figure 1). In this work, the authors used <i>Kellog's Strawberry Pop Tarts with Real Smucker's Fruit</i>. SPTs can be obtained either with or without frosting; the non-frosting variety were used for this experiment.</p>
